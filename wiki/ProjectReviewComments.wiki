  * Mention the limitations of the project. Some of them include: The library works only if getters and setters are generated for a POJO class. No need to pass instance and class, we can get class from the instance itself.
  * The output contains getId = 1, getName = "Triguna", can it be like Id = 1, Name = "Triguna"?
  * Anything else?
